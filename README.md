# Getting Started with Create React App
Hi! This is my pet project where I've been learning how to leverage the full power of Redux Toolkit structure in a React app. It offers amazing tools and comprehensive documentation on how to work with it. By using a global state in your React app, you can enjoy its benefits.

I've also implemented the thunk middleware, and I can show you how it looks inside. If you have any questions, I'll be more than happy to answer them. Have a nice day!

To get started, please open the console in your project folder and run the following command to clone the app:
Open your IDE 
Copy url app
git clone [app-url]
Install all the dependencies by running npm i. Open two separate console windows. In one of them, run npx json-server heroes.json and press Enter. In the other console window, run npm start and press Enter.
